# Introducing Popbox

Popbox is a lightweight, unobtrusive script for displaying images in a Web page. Written entirely in JavaScript and CSS, Popbox weighs in at just 5.8 kb, and relies on no external dependencies. Popbox was designed as a smaller, simpler replacement for other image presentation scripts such as [Lightbox][light], [Slimbox][slim], and [FancyZoom][fancy].

[fancy]: http://www.cabel.name/2008/02/fancyzoom-10.html

Setup is a snap. All you have to download is the script and the CSS. Include the script in the head of your document, and add `data-popbox="popbox"` to links you want to open with Popbox.

Popbox has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
